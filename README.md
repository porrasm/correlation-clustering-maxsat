# correlation-clustering-maxsat

This code focuses on different encodings of the correlation clustering instance. Most of the encodings are described in this paper: [Cost-Optimal Constrained Correlation Clustering via
Weighted Partial Maximum Satisfiability](https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/mjarvisa/papers/berg-jarvisalo.aij15.pdf)

The encoder directory contains the encodings while the visualizer directory contains debugging tools.
